This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I have been working in IT in various sales-enablement capacities (RFP support, technical community management, and content management) since I first began my career in 2019. 
I was recently laid off and am looking to upskill. I learn through applying new concepts to real life use cases. So, I thought I'd start a digital CV to impress prospective employers.
